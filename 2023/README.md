# Solution notes

## Day 1

I got trapped by both parts. In the first part, I ended up with an awful regex like `/\D*(\d).*?(\d?)\D*$/`. In the second part, that regex led me astray; I preprocessed each line by replacing each word from left to right. The problem was sneakily-worded to make that seem viable.

## Day 2

Stumbled on min vs max for part 2, but otherwise went smoothly!
