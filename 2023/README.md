# Solution notes

## Day 1

I got trapped by both parts. In the first part, I ended up with an awful regex like `/\D*(\d).*?(\d?)\D*$/`. In the second part, that regex led me astray; I preprocessed each line by replacing each word from left to right. The problem was sneakily-worded to make that seem viable.

## Day 2

Stumbled on min vs max for part 2, but otherwise went smoothly!

## Day 3

Part 1 was a nightmare. I kept getting the example correct, but failing on the real input. Tried a lot of things: using negative numbers, treating digits as symbols, etc. I even rewrote my solution into a different language to try to figure it out. Turns out I had two different off-by-one errors (one carried over into my Perl). Part 2 was quick and painless.

# Day 4

Part 1 was quick and easy. Part 2 I ended up with an exponential solution (maintain a queue of card IDs to process; I could have at least cached the score of each cardâ€¦). I had a working solution at 00:07:31 (which would have put me somewhere between rank 101-200), but it took too long to run so I assumed I hit an infinite loop. I faffed around for a bit, ran a release build (which still took 5 seconds), and got the star at 14 mins.
